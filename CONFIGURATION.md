# Configuration Guide

Paneru is configured via a TOML file. By default, it looks for the configuration in the following locations (in order):

1.  `$PANERU_CONFIG` (environment variable)
2.  `$HOME/.paneru`
3.  `$HOME/.paneru.toml`
4.  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/paneru/paneru.toml`

The configuration is automatically reloaded when the file is saved.

## 1. Global Options (`[options]`)

General behavior settings for the window manager.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `focus_follows_mouse` | Boolean | `true` | If enabled, the window under the mouse cursor will automatically gain focus. |
| `mouse_follows_focus` | Boolean | `true` | If enabled, the mouse cursor will warp to the center of the focused window when focus changes via keyboard. |
| `horizontal_mouse_warp` | Integer ``(-1, 1)`` | Off | If enabled, the mouse will warp to another screen above or below, when touching the left or right edge. The direction depends on the direction - a negative value will cause the left edge to warp to a screen above and the right edge to a screen below. This allows having horizontal positioning of displays while having them aligned in a virtual layout in macOS settings. The cursor lands at the *opposite* edge of the target display (preserving cursor flow), with the source's relative Y position. Carries pre-warp horizontal velocity to avoid a "standing start", and skips the warp when the equivalent Y has no position on the target — matching macOS's native side-by-side behavior for displays of unequal height. (inspired by https://github.com/mogenson/WarpMouse.spoon) |
| `horizontal_mouse_warp_offset` | Integer (px) | `0` | Vertical pixel offset applied to the `horizontal_mouse_warp` landing position, signed by warp direction. Positive values shift the cursor lower when warping to a display *below* (in macOS arrangement) and higher when warping to one *above*. Use to compensate for physical desk arrangement differing from the macOS arrangement (e.g. portrait monitor sitting physically higher or lower than the laptop). |
| `preset_column_widths` | Array (Float) | `[0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 0.66, 0.75]` | Ratios of the screen width used by the `window_resize` command to cycle sizes. |
| `animation_speed` | Float | `50` | Speed of window animations (1/10th of screen size per second). Set to a very high value to effectively disable animations. |
| `auto_center` | Boolean | `false` | Automatically center the focused window on the screen when switching focus. |
| `sliver_height` | Float (0.1–1.0) | `1.0` | Vertical ratio of off-screen windows kept visible to prevent macOS from relocating them. |
| `sliver_width` | Integer (px) | `5` | Horizontal width of off-screen windows kept visible. |
| `menubar_height` | Integer (px) | *Auto* | Manually override the detected macOS menubar height. |
| `window_hidden_ratio` | Float (0.0–1.0) | `0.0` | How much of a window can be hidden before it's forced into view on focus change. `0.0` = eager, `1.0` = lazy. |
| `window_resize_cycle` | Boolean | `true` | If disabled, `window_resize` and `window_shrink` stop at the largest/smallest preset instead of cycling back. |

---

## 2. Padding (`[padding]`)

Sets the margins at the edges of the screen.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `top` | Integer (px) | `0` | Padding at the top of the screen. |
| `bottom` | Integer (px) | `0` | Padding at the bottom of the screen. |
| `left` | Integer (px) | `0` | Padding at the left edge. |
| `right` | Integer (px) | `0` | Padding at the right edge. |

---

## 3. Swipe & Gestures (`[swipe]`)

Configure trackpad gestures and scroll-wheel window sliding.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `sensitivity` | Float (0.1–2.0) | `0.35` | Multiplier for swipe distance. |
| `deceleration` | Float (1.0–10.0) | `4.0` | Rate at which inertia slows down after a swipe. |
| `continuous` | Boolean | `true` | If enabled, the swipe gesture moves windows smoothly with the fingers. If disabled, it snaps to windows as you swipe. |

### `[swipe.gesture]`
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `fingers_count` | Integer | *None* | Number of fingers for the swipe gesture. Set to 3 or more to enable. |
| `direction` | String | `"Natural"` | Direction of movement: `"Natural"` or `"Reversed"`. |

### `[swipe.scroll]`
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `modifier` | String | `"alt"` | Modifier key(s) required to slide windows with the scroll wheel: `"alt"`, `"rcmd"`, `"ralt + cmd"`, `"lctrl + lalt + cmd"`, etc. |
| `vertical_modifier` | String | *None* | Additional modifier key that, when held together with `modifier`, switches virtual workspaces vertically instead of scrolling horizontally. For example, if `modifier = "alt"` and `vertical_modifier = "shift"`, then `alt + scroll` slides windows horizontally and `alt + shift + scroll` switches virtual workspace rows. |

---

## 4. Decorations (`[decorations]`)

Visual styling for active and inactive windows.

### `[decorations.inactive.dim] (Native macOS Dimming)`

Paneru supports native macOS window dimming. To use this mode, **only** set `opacity` (and optionally `opacity_night`). Do not set a `color`.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `opacity` | Float (-1.0 to 1.0) | `0.0` | Dimming intensity. `-1.0` is fully black, `1.0` is fully white. |
| `opacity_night` | Float (-1.0 to 1.0) | *opacity* | Dimming intensity used when macOS is in Dark Mode. |

**Example:**
```toml
[decorations.inactive.dim]
opacity = -0.15
opacity_night = -0.25
```

---

## 5. Keybindings (`[bindings]`)

Bindings map a key combination to an action. A binding can be a single string or an array of strings.
Format: `"[modifiers-]key"`. Available modifiers are:
- `alt`, `lalt`, `ralt`
- `ctrl`, `lctrl`, `rctrl`
- `cmd`, `lcmd`, `rcmd`
- `shift`, `lshift`, `rshift`

| Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `window_focus_west` / `_east` | Focus window to the left/right. |
| `window_focus_north` / `_south` | Focus window above/below. If no window exists, switches focus to the display in that direction. |
| `window_focus_first` / `_last` | Jump to the start/end of the strip. |
| `window_swap_west` / `_east` | Swap current window with neighbor. |
| `window_swap_north` / `_south` | Swap current window above/below. If no window exists, moves the window to the display in that direction. |
| `window_swap_first` / `_last` | Move current window to start/end of strip. |
| `window_center` | Center the current window in the viewport. |
| `window_resize` | Cycle through preset widths (Grow). |
| `window_grow` | Alias for `window_resize`. |
| `window_shrink` | Cycle through preset widths (Shrink). |
| `window_fullwidth` | Toggle full-width mode. |
| `window_manage` | Toggle between tiled and floating state. |
| `window_stack` | Stack the current window into the column on the left. |
| `window_unstack` | Pull a window out of a stack into its own column. |
| `window_equalize` | Make all windows in a stack equal height. |
| `window_nextdisplay` | Move focused window to the next monitor and follow it. |
| `window_nextdisplaysend` | Move focused window to the next monitor but stay on current. |
| `mouse_nextdisplay` | Warp mouse cursor to the next monitor. |
| `window_snap` | Snap an overflowing window into the viewport. |
| `quit` | Exit Paneru. |

**Example:**
```toml
[bindings]
window_focus_west = "cmd - h"
window_resize = ["alt - r", "ctrl - r"]
```

### Virtual workspaces (Experimental)

Paneru allows having virtual spaces inside of the native macOS workspace.
Logically it can be thought of several strips of windows (rows) stacked on top
of each other within the single workspace. Similar to how Niri implements the
movement between the vertical workspaces.

Shifting up or down goes to the previous or next strip of windows - wrapping
around at the start or the end.

Moving the last window out of the virtual row, will "collapse it".

Virtual workspaces can also be navigated using trackpad gestures. If `[swipe.gesture]` is configured, a vertical 3/4-finger swipe will switch between virtual workspace rows, while horizontal swipes continue to scroll the strip as usual. For mouse users, see the `vertical_modifier` option under `[swipe.scroll]`.

| Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `window_virtual_north` / `_south` | Switch to the previous/next virtual workspace (row of windows). |
| `window_virtualmove_north` / `_south` | Move currently focused window to the previous/next virtual workspace and follow it. |
| `window_virtualsend_north` / `_south` | Move currently focused window to the previous/next virtual workspace but stay on the current one. |


**Example:**
```toml
[bindings]
window_virtual_north = "cmd + shift - k"
window_virtual_south = "cmd + shift - j"
window_virtualmove_north = "cmd + alt - k"
window_virtualmove_south = "cmd + alt - j"
```

**Example command line:**
```shell
# Move to the previous virtual workspace.
$ paneru send-cmd window virtual north
# Move the current window to the next virtual workspace.
$ paneru send-cmd window virtualmove south
```

## 6. Window Rules (`[windows]`)

Define specific behaviors for applications based on their Title or Bundle ID.

| Option | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `title` | Regex | **(Required)** Regex pattern to match the window title. |
| `bundle_id` | String | Optional Bundle ID to match (e.g., `com.apple.Terminal`). |
| `floating` | Boolean | Force the window to be floating/unmanaged. |
| `index` | Integer | Preferred position in the strip when spawned. |
| `dont_focus` | Boolean | Prevent the window from taking focus when spawned. |
| `width` | Float (0.0–1.0) | Initial width ratio for the window. |
| `grid` | String | placement for floating windows: `"cols:rows:x:y:w:h"`. |
| `horizontal_padding` | Integer | Gaps to the left/right of this window. |
| `vertical_padding` | Integer | Gaps to the top/bottom of this window. |
| `bindings_passthrough`| Array (String)| Keys that should bypass Paneru and go directly to the app. |

**Example:**
```toml
[windows.terminal]
title = ".*"
bundle_id = "com.apple.Terminal"
horizontal_padding = 5
bindings_passthrough = ["ctrl-h", "ctrl-l"]
```

## 7. Experimental Features

> [!WARNING]
> These features rely on undocumented macOS window-server APIs and have known issues. For example, overlay windows (like YouTube Picture-in-Picture) may be partially shaded, and layer ordering can behave unexpectedly. Both features are **disabled by default**. 
>
> Disabling **System Integrity Protection (SIP)** is **not required**, but without it Paneru has limited control over window layering, which is the root cause of most visual edge-cases. Enable these only if you are comfortable with occasional glitches.

### Inactive Window Overlay Dimming
Another dimming option that draws a translucent overlay on every inactive window to visually emphasize the focused one. 

**Activation:** This mode is enabled by setting **both** `opacity` and `color` under `[decorations.inactive.dim]`. In this mode, `opacity` ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `opacity` | Float (0.0 to 1.0) | `0.0` | Opacity of the dim overlay. `0.0` is transparent, `1.0` is opaque. |
| `color` | String (Hex) | `"#000000"` | Hex color for the dim overlay (default: black). |

**Example:**
```toml
[decorations.inactive.dim]
opacity = 0.3
color = "#000000"
```

### Active Window Border
Draws a colored border around the currently focused window.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `enabled` | Boolean | `false` | Enable the active window border. |
| `color` | String (Hex) | `"#FFFFFF"` | Hex color for the active window border. |
| `opacity` | Float (0.0–1.0) | `1.0` | Opacity of the active window border. |
| `width` | Float (px) | `2.0` | Width of the border in pixels. |
| `radius` | Number/String | `"auto"` | Corner radius in pixels or `"auto"` to match system. |

**Example:**
```toml
[decorations.active.border]
enabled = true
color = "#89b4fa"
width = 2.0
radius = 12.0
```

> **Tip:** You can override the `border_radius` for specific applications in the `[windows]` section. See [Window Rules](#6-window-rules).
